# Project for learning Web Scraping

When we are working in a Test driven environment, there are three
steps to the flow:

- Stub out the main function we want to test
- Write the test function for the main function
- Implement the main function

## JEST

- Jest is a testing module for node projects
- The way Jest works is, it looks files in the working directory that end with .test.js !!
- So it is important that way name our test files with .test.js @ the end.
